                        The holidays are supposed to be a time of joy and family togetherness. But, for many people, they can also trigger feelings of loneliness, <a href"https://resilientmindcounseling.com/tips-for-seasonal-depression-treatment-north-carolina/">depression</a>, or anxiety. In fact, some studies show that up to 70% of Americans experience symptoms of depression during the holidays. What causes this? The answer is complicated but there are some factors that can increase someone’s risk of developing depression during the holidays such as increased exposure to alcohol (which is a depressant), fatigue from traveling or staying up late, stress from shopping, volunteering, etc., grief over the loss of a loved one and exposure to family members you don’t often see (and may not get along with).

                    The holiday blues are common and normal as they are often triggered by changes in our daily routines or schedules which make it more difficult for us to cope with our daily lives at home or work. For example:

                            It’s very common for up to 70% of people to experience a bout of holiday blues. In its most severe forms, it’s known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</a>.
